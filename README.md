SLEEPING ALARM SYSTEM - Python Project

The Sleeping Alarm System is a Python-based mini-project that leverages computer vision libraries to detect when a user is sleeping while using their computer or desktop. Using webcam input, the system analyzes the user's facial expressions and posture to determine sleep status. Upon detecting that the user has fallen asleep, the system triggers an alarm to alert the user and prevent prolonged drowsiness during computer use.
